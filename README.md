# LSTM for Robot Arm Control

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for controlling a robot arm. The LSTM model is trained to predict and execute precise movements of the robot arm based on input commands and environmental feedback. The implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook named `LSTM-for-Robot-Arm-Control.ipynb`.

## Features
- **LSTM-based Control**: Utilize LSTM networks to model temporal dependencies in robot arm control tasks.
- **Simulation Environment**: Includes a simulated environment for training and testing the robot arm.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Processes dynamic feedback to adjust movements in real-time.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the robot arm’s movements and the LSTM’s predictions.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt`):
  ```
  numpy
  tensorflow
  matplotlib
  pandas
  ```
- Optional: Robot simulation software (e.g., PyBullet or ROS for advanced users).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LSTM-for-Robot-Arm-Control.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd LSTM-for-Robot-Arm-Control
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the `LSTM-for-Robot-Arm-Control.ipynb` file.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load or generate training data.
   - Train the LSTM model.
   - Simulate and visualize robot arm movements.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Collect or simulate training data representing the desired movements of the robot arm.
2. **LSTM Training**: Train the LSTM model to predict the next position of the robot arm based on input sequences.
3. **Control Execution**: Use the trained LSTM model to generate control commands for the robot arm.
4. **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate feedback to refine movements and improve accuracy.

## Example
- **Input**: A sequence of joint angle commands.
- **Output**: Predicted joint positions for smooth and precise robot arm control.

## Customization
You can modify the notebook to:
- Use different LSTM architectures (e.g., bidirectional or stacked LSTMs).
- Train on custom datasets for specific robot arm configurations.
- Integrate with real-world robot hardware (requires additional setup).
